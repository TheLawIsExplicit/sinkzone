What SinkZone does
- SinkZone blocks DNS queries by default.
- It only resolves names on an allowlist.
- It rejects or sinks all other names.
- It gives you predictable internet access.
- It limits distractions.
- It gives parents control.

Key benefits
- Focus. Block social feeds, apps, and trackers.
- Safety. Prevent access to adult content and unsafe sites.
- Productivity. Keep only work-related domains.
- Simplicity. One list controls access.
- Flexibility. Per-device or per-network rules.
- Auditability. Logs show allowed and blocked queries.

How it works
SinkZone acts as a DNS server. You point clients to it as the resolver. It accepts queries. It checks each name against an allowlist. If the name matches the allowlist, SinkZone resolves the name via an upstream resolver. If not, SinkZone returns a sink response. Sink responses can be NXDOMAIN or an IP such as 0.0.0.0. You choose the sink behavior.

Key concepts
- Allowlist: the single source of truth for allowed names.
- Sink response: the reply for blocked names.
- Upstream resolver: the DNS server SinkZone uses for allowed names.
- Profiles: sets of allowlist entries for different contexts.
- Devices: clients that use SinkZone.

Architecture
- Frontend DNS server:
  - UDP and TCP on port 53.
  - Optional DoT or DoH endpoints.
- Allowlist engine:
  - Fast path match for exact names.
  - Wildcard and suffix match for domains.
  - Regex support for advanced rules.
- Policy engine:
  - Per-IP, per-subnet, per-profile rules.
  - Time window rules.
- Upstream connector:
  - Supports multiple upstreams.
  - Failover and parallel queries.
- Cache:
  - In-memory cache with TTL respect.
  - Optional persistent cache.
- Logging:
  - Structured logs (JSON).
  - Query logs and decision logs.
- Management API:
  - Local HTTP API for config and stats.
  - Authentication support.

- Example unit file:
  ```ini
  [Unit]
  Description=SinkZone DNS server
  After=network.target

  [Service]
  User=root
  ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/sinkzone --config /etc/sinkzone/config.yaml

  - sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  - sudo systemctl enable sinkzone
  - sudo systemctl start sinkzone

macOS (launchd)
- Use a plist to run the binary at boot.
- Place the binary in /usr/local/bin.
- Use launchctl to load the plist.

Windows
- Use the installer from the Releases page.
- The installer registers SinkZone as a service.
- Use the management UI or CLI to configure.

Docker
- Example docker run:
  ```bash
  docker run -d \
    --name sinkzone \
    --restart unless-stopped \
    -p 53:53/udp -p 53:53/tcp \
    -v /opt/sinkzone/config.yaml:/etc/sinkzone/config.yaml:ro \
    sinkzone/sinkzone:1.2.3
  ```
- Map config and logs to host volumes.

Raspberry Pi / Home router
- Use the ARM release or build from source.
- Run on the Pi and set your router DHCP to point clients to the Pi IP.
- For OpenWrt, run SinkZone inside a container or on a separate host.

Configuration

Primary config file (YAML)
- server:
  - listen: 0.0.0.0:53
  - doh: 127.0.0.1:443

- profiles:
  - default: /etc/sinkzone/allowlists/default.txt
  - kids: /etc/sinkzone/allowlists/kids.txt
- logging:

Time-based profiles
- Define profiles with active windows.
- Example:
  - kids: 07:00-20:00
  - focus: 09:00-17:00
- SinkZone switches profiles for clients by IP or MAC.

- Apply:
  - Use profile assigned to kiosk IP or VLAN.

Advanced topics

Upstream resolution
- SinkZone supports multiple upstreams.
- Use parallel queries for speed.
- Use failover when an upstream fails.
- Use specific upstream per domain if you trust an upstream for a namespace.

DNS over TLS / DNS over HTTPS
- SinkZone can send allowed queries to DoT or DoH endpoints.
- Configure certificate validation.
- Use DoH for networks that block port 53.

Caching and TTL
- SinkZone respects the TTL from upstream.
- Configure minimum and maximum cache TTL.
- Use persistent cache to survive restarts.

Logs and metrics
- Query logs show:
  - timestamp, client IP, queried name, decision, upstream
- Decision logs show why a name passed or failed.
- Metrics:
  - queries per second
  - hit ratio
  - blocked count
- Export metrics to Prometheus.

Health checks
- Expose an HTTP health endpoint.
- Provide metrics for uptime and cache stats.
- Use the endpoint in service monitors.

Network setup

Home network
- Run SinkZone on a Pi or NAS.
- Set your router DHCP to hand out SinkZone as DNS.
- For devices that use hardcoded DNS, use firewall rules to redirect DNS to SinkZone.

Office network
- Run SinkZone on a dedicated server or container.
- Point DHCP to SinkZone.
- Use VLANs to separate guest and staff traffic.
- Apply different profiles per VLAN.

Remote workers
- Use a VPN to route remote DNS to SinkZone.
- Alternatively, offer a DoH endpoint for remote clients.
- Enforce client auth for DoH.

Testing and validation

Basic tests
- dig @sinkzone-ip example.com
- dig @sinkzone-ip socialsite.example
- Expected: allowed names return A/AAAA. Blocked names return NXDOMAIN or sink IP.

Profile tests
- Test with client IP bound to a profile.
- Test time-based activation by changing system time or schedule.

Edge cases
- Catch captive portals that intercept DNS.
- Handle DNSSEC validation if required by your upstream.

Troubleshooting

Common issues
- Clients still use other DNS:
  - Check DHCP settings.
  - Check firewall rules.
- SinkZone not binding to port 53:
  - Check permission or port conflict.
  - Stop other DNS services.
- Upstream failure:
  - Check network and upstream IPs.
  - Check DoT/DoH certificates.

Debugging tips
- Use tcpdump to capture DNS packets.
- Use dig for manual queries.
- Check logs at /var/log/sinkzone or journalctl.

Security

Best practices
- Run SinkZone on a minimal host.
- Update SinkZone via the releases page.
- Use least privilege for the service user.
- Restrict access to the management API.
- Use TLS for DoH and DoT.

Data handling
- Logs contain DNS queries.
- Retain logs only as long as needed.
- Use log rotation and secure log storage.

FAQ

Q: What DNS reply does SinkZone return for blocked names?
A: You choose. SinkZone supports NXDOMAIN or an IP sink. Use NXDOMAIN to break resolution. Use a sink IP to route blocked requests to a local info page.

Q: Can SinkZone allow subdomains?
A: Yes. Use wildcard or suffix entries. Example: .trusted allows any subdomain of trusted.

Q: Can I run SinkZone and another DNS server side by side?
A: You must avoid port conflicts. Use different ports or run on separate hosts. For production, run SinkZone as the primary resolver.

Q: How do I allow a new site during the day?
A: Add it to the active profile allowlist. SinkZone reloads the list without restart. You can push changes via API.

Q: How does SinkZone handle CDN domains that serve both allowed and blocked content?
A: Use exact hostnames for specific services. Use path or SNI based rules in upstream proxies if needed.

  ```nginx
  server {
    listen 80;
    server_name _;
    root /var/www/sinkzone;

  ```
  option domain-name-servers 192.168.1.10;
  ```

iptables redirect for forced DNS

  ```bash
  iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p udp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.10:53
  iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 53 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.10:53
  ```

Monitoring with Prometheus
- Expose metrics on /metrics.
- Scrape endpoint with Prometheus.

Audit tools

Generate a report of blocked queries per client
- Use logs to compute top blocked hostnames.
- Export to CSV for review.

Privacy and data
- SinkZone logs DNS queries.
- Mask or anonymize client IPs if needed.
- Store logs on systems you control.

Scaling tips
- Use multiple SinkZone instances behind a load balancer.
- Use shared cache or consistent hashing for cache pinning.
- For high QPS, use a compiled binary on a server with large NIC buffers.

Testing at scale
- Use dnsperf or queryperf to simulate load.
- Monitor latency and cache hit ratio.

Backup and restore
- Backup allowlist files.
- Backup config.yaml and certs.
- Use snapshot and restore for persistent cache if enabled.

Maintenance

- CLI: status, reload, push allowlist.

Testing checklist before deployment
- Confirm binary runs on your OS.
- Confirm DNS binding on port 53.
- Test queries for allowed and blocked names.
- Verify DHCP points to SinkZone.
- Test DoH/DoT if used.
- Validate log generation.

Release and upgrade procedure
- Download new release asset from Releases.
- Stop service.
- Replace binary or run installer.
- Run config validator if provided.
- Start service and verify.

Releases again
- The release file must be downloaded and executed from the Releases page. Find the release asset for your OS and architecture at:
