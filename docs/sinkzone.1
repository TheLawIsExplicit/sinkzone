.TH SINKZONE 1 "July 2025" "Sinkzone 0.1.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
sinkzone \- DNS-based productivity tool that blocks distractions and helps you stay focused
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sinkzone
[\fICOMMAND\fR] [\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Sinkzone is a DNS-based productivity tool designed to reduce distractions and help you focus. It works by running a local DNS resolver that intercepts domain name queries. During focus sessions, only domains explicitly allowed via the allowlist will resolve â€” everything else is silently blocked.

The typical workflow:
.IP 1.
Start the DNS resolver with \fBsinkzone resolver\fR
.IP 2.
Use \fBsinkzone monitor\fR to view live DNS requests
.IP 3.
Add essential domains to your allowlist with \fBsinkzone allowlist add\fR
.IP 4.
Enable focus mode with \fBsinkzone focus enable <duration>\fR
